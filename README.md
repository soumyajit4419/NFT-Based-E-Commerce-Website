# 📱 _E-Commerce Website with Warranty attached NFT's_ 

_**Buy any Product and get warranty attached NFT**_ <br />

### 🎯 Our Goals :

1.  Product warranty card as an NFT.
2.  Ownership of product through NFTs
3.  Sellers selling their products and verify warranty
4.  User can sell their product 

## 📝 Product Description

_📌 **Users can prove ownership**_ <br/>
After the customer purchases the product through our website, we mint an NFT and send it to the user's wallet address and store the product warranty with the NFT. In this way, with each product that the user purchases, the corresponding NFT is fully owned by the user. It allows users to get the physical product along with its digital version and prove the ownership of product.

_📌 **Providing the purchasing history, warranty period, and other item information**_ <br/>
The user can view the purchase history of all the products ordered by that specific user. They  can also view the NFT details, product warranty details, product details and address details.

_📌 **Warranty Card containing the product’s serial number**_ <br/>
The Warranty card will contain the product’s serial number which will be unique for every product bought using our website as we generate a unique serial number while minting the NFT for every product ordered through our website.

_📌 **Transfer Ownership**_ <br/>
We have added a feature to transfer the already minted NFTs to another user. We give the user the opportunity to list for sale the particular product they wish to transfer ownership of. To do so, the current owner of the product, i.e. the user, will have to approve the popup coming from MetaMask. After it is done the item will be on sale. When the user does this in the sale section of ​​the application, that specific product will be displayed there. The user who puts the product for sale cannot buy the product again. Any other user using our website can buy sale products from this section and after that, the product will be transferred to that particular user from the previous owner.

_📌 **On purchase the customer will get a notification on their smartphone**_ <br/>
We are using the Twilio free messaging service and sending a message when the customer successfully places the order.

_📌 **For Brands and Retailers**_ <br/>
For the brands and retailers we have added a separate feature like they can add any product of their brand to our website and they will be able to see all the products of their brand ordered by the user with the warranty information of each product with the user details. By this, the brands / retailers will be able to get the user details and approve when the user requests for replacements and repairs.
